Any dependencies listed in the package.json dependency section come with their own licenses, which must be respected.

This package contains indicated below:

This project contains third-party software components governed by their own license and copyright notices.  
Therefore a system to interpret their application has been defined, namedly 'Directory-Based Recursive Licensing' (from here on referred to as 'DBRL').

DBRL states that license and/or copyright notices in a directory will apply to all files in that directory, and all subdirectories in that directory.  
This application continues recursively. 
So a license file at path '/A/LICENSE.txt` will apply to '/A/*' and '/A/**/*' 
However, any subdirectory that introduces a new license or copyright notice shall be considered the end of the application of the above license (in that specific hierarchy) and the beginning of a new hierarchy.  
Therefore, including license and copyright notices at the root of a project covers all files and directories in the project, except those with other specified license or copyright notices.
